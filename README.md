## Wins 
- A few wins we had was getting our serach bar to work dynamicly it felt great to use
- Another win was refactoring for router only took a hour
- One of the bigger wins was using navagate to automaticlly reroute the user

## Struggles 
- A struggle we had was defintly getting the testing working it took a lot just to get cypress to even open our page but we eventually figured out it had to do with our intercept body not having the correct data
- Another struggle was having the filter function use sort becuase then that would mess up our fetched data what we did to fix this was use toSorted it does the same thing wihtout mutateing the oringal data
- A big struggle we had was useParamas wasnt working due to use importing using react insted of react-router-dom Pareesa ending up catching it and saving us a lot of time
